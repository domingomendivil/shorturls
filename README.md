# URL Shortener
This project is for URL shortening.
Given a URL like http://www.google.com, a shorter URL like http://me.li/JKSD8X is associated. 
The domain of the short URL can be configured, so the short URL can be http://do.li or https://con.me or anything else. 

The following are the implemented REST services:

 **Short URL Creation**: Creates a short URL associated with a given original URL.
 
 **Short URL Deletion**: Deletes a short URL already created.

 **Short URL Query**: Returns the original URL associated with a given short URL.
